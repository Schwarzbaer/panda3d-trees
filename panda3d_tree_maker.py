# 4.1 The curved stem
# nCurveRes -> segments
# nCurve -> bend
# nCurveBack -> bend_back
# Instead of using a variance of 0 to max, we use -max to max:
#   bend = nCurve + nCurveV
#   bend_var = nCurveV / 2
# missing: helical stem
#
# The stem is divided into nCurveRes segments.
# if nCurveV < 0.0:
#     stem is formed as a helix. The declination angle is specified by magnitude(nCurveVary)
#     FIXME: That bit is unclear; Are we talking about the twist value?
# elif not nCurveBack:
#     the z-axis of each segment on the stem is rotated away from z-axis of the previous segment by (nCurve/nCurveRes) degrees
# else:
#     in the first half of the stemis rotated (nCurve/(nCurveRes/2)) degrees and
#     each in the second half is rotated (nCurveBack/(nCurveRes/2)) degrees.
# In either case, a random rotation of magnitude (nCurveV/nCurveRes) is also added for each segment.


# 4.2 Stem Splits
# nSegSplits -> branches
# nBaseSplits -> trunk_splits
# nSplitAngle -> split_angle
# nSplitAngleV -> split_angle_var
#
# missing: error diffusion, clone rotation, split angle diffusion, ...
#
# * Fractional branching: DONE
#   At each segment, a stems can split into multiple clones. The frequency of splitting is defined by nSegSplits.
#   This is the number of new clones added for each segment along the stem and is usually between 0 and 1, with 1 referring to a dichotomous split
#   on every  segment. A value of 2 would indicate a ternary split.
#   There is an additional parameter nBaseSplits that specifies the equivalent of nSegSplits at the end of the first segment of the trunk.
#   This allows for an independent number of splits at the base of the tree, thus permitting trees that seem to have multiple trunks with few
#   further splitting tendencies.
#   Fractional values of nSegSplits will cause additional splits to be evenly distributed throughout all segments of all stems in that particular
#   level of recursion. For example, an nSegSplits of 1.2 will form one clone on 80% of the level n segments and two clones on 20% of the segments.
#   Note that this yields an average number of 1.2 splits per segment.  Using random numbers simplistically to distribute the fractional part of
#   nSegSplits is unacceptable because when, by chance, several consecutive segments all get the extra split, they can forman unnaturally large
#   number of stems in close proximity on part of the tree.
# * Error diffusion: DONE
#   To evenly distribute the splits, we use a technique similar to Floyd-Steinburg Error Diffusion.
#   For each recursive level, a global value holds an "error value" initialized to 0.0.
#   Each time nSegSplits is used, this error is added to create a SegSplits_effective which is rounded to the nearest integer.
#   The difference (SegSplits_effective - nSegSplits) is subtracted from the error.
#   So, if a value is rounded up, it is more likely that the next value will be rounded down (and vice versa).
# * Angle split? DONE
#   If there are any clones, then the z-axes of the stem and its clones each rotate away from the z-axis of the previous segment by
#       anglesplit = (nSplitAngle Â± nSplitAngleV) - declination, limited to a minimum of 0
#     where the "declination" angle (defined here as the angle of a stem from the tree's positive z-axis) can be found by taking the inverse cosine
#     of the z component of a unit z vector passed through the current matrix transformation of the relative coordinate system.
#   The first clone continues the original mesh and cannot rotate around the z-axis or it would twist the mesh (i.e., if one rotated one of the
#     circular faces on a cylinder about the longitudinal axis, the resulting section of geometry would render as a hourglass shape).
#   This anglesplit is later distributed over the remaining segments in the reverse direction so that the stem will tend to return to its originally
#     intended direction. This compensation prevents overspreading due to large numbers of stem splits. The extent that any level of stems spreads
#     out can be easily controlled using the curve parameters.
# * Stem split rotation around tree's z: DONE, kinda. No information about rotation of any segments except the first of two are given.
#   A stem and its clones are also spread apart by rotating them about an axis that is parallel to the z-axis of the tree.
#   In the normal case of a single clone, the original stem (which is continued after its clone is created) is rotated about the parallel axis by
#   an angle of magnitude:
#   [ 20 + 0.75 * (30 + | declination-90 |  )  *  RANDOM(0  to  1) ^ 2]
#   The sign of this angle is random as well.
